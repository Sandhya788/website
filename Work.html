IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is a standard email protocol that stores email messages on a mail server, but allows the end user to view and manipulate the messages as though they were stored locally on the end user's computing device(s). This allows users to organize messages into folders, have multiple client applications know which messages have been read, flag messages for urgency or follow-up and save draft messages on the server.

IMAP can be contrasted with another client/server email protocol, Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3). With POP3, mail is saved for the end user in a single mailbox on the server and moved to the end user's device when the mail client opens. While POP3 can be thought of as a "store-and-forward" service, IMAP can be thought of as a remote file server.

Most implementations of IMAP support multiple logins; this allows the end user to simultaneously connect to the email server with different devices. For example, the end user could connect to the mail server with his Outlook iPhone app and his Outlook desktop client at the same time. The details for how to handle multiple connections are not specified by the protocol but are instead left to the developers of the mail client.

Even though IMAP has an authentication mechanism, the authentication process can easily be circumvented by anyone who knows how to steal a password by using a protocol analyzer because the client’s username and password are transmitted as clear text. In an Exchange Server environment, administrators can work around this security flaw by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption for IMAP.

EMIAL PROTOCOLS:
The Internet Message Access Protocol is an Application Layer Internet protocol that allows an e-mail client to access email on a remote mail server. The current version is defined by RFC 3501. An IMAP server typically listens on well-known port 143, while IMAP over SSL (IMAPS) uses 993.

Incoming email messages are sent to an email server that stores messages in the recipient's email box. The user retrieves the messages with an email client that uses one of a number of email retrieval protocols. While some clients and servers preferentially use vendor-specific, proprietary protocols,almost all support POP and IMAP for retrieving email – allowing many free choice between many e-mail clients such as Pegasus Mail or Mozilla Thunderbird to access these servers, and allows the clients to be used with other servers.

Email clients using IMAP generally leave messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them. This and other characteristics of IMAP operation allow multiple clients to manage the same mailbox. Most email clients support IMAP in addition to Post Office Protocol (POP) to retrieve messages.IMAP offers access to the mail storage. Clients may store local copies of the messages, but these are considered to be a temporary cache.
